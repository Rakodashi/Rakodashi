- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rakodashi, or Rafaela if you prefer! I use they/them and she/her pronouns. I'm a 24 year old Graphic Designer, and I've been studying programming for about a year now. My main focus at this moment are the front-end/web development areas.

- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development & Computer Science, programming in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C, SQL & UI/UX.

- 🌱 I’m currently studying the Harvard's CS50 Intruduction to Computer Science, and Introduction to programming with Python courses. I've completed a 10  day Intensive Coding Course at Alura and I'm currently learning all the basics for Web Development. I'm also focusing on learning React and managing the other site/app related particularities of this area.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any begginer-friendly projects that may increase my knowledge and experience with coding and webdeb/computer science in general.
