- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rakodashi, or Rafa if you prefer! I use they/them and she/her pronouns. I'm a 24 year old Graphic Designer, and I've recently been studying programming because I'm looking to work more towards this area.

- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science, programming in Python, C, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, HTML & UI/UX.

- 🌱 I’m currently studying the Harvard's CS50 Intruduction to Computer Science, and Introduction to programming with Python courses. I've also recently started a 10  day Intensive Coding Course at Alura.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any begginer friendly projects that may increase my knowledge and experience with coding and computer science in general.
